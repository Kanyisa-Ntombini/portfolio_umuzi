            <h2>Hello there!</h2>
            <p>I am an aspiring self-taught Full Stack Web Developer. My interests are in Javascript and Python. For the past few months, I have been learning about Front End development using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am also interested in building chatbots and Machine Learning. As a result, I have been learning Python. You can find more information about me in my <a href="./resources/supporting_documents/Black & White Minimalistic Professional Resume.pdf">resume</a>.
            <br><br>
            I am partially sighted due to a condition called Keratoconus. This has led to me becoming a disability activist. I would like to build accessible websites so that all people are able to use them despite their physical or mental condition.
            <br><br>
            When I am not coding I like taking nature walks, looking for the cosiest coffee shops in town or spending time with my friends and family. I am also an avid knitter!</p>

        <p>These are some of the projects I created. Please click on the name
          of each project to view it. The first project is a webpage for a 
          coffee shop. The next is a prototype designed on Figma of an app 
          where customers can order coffee as a takeaway from the coffee shop.
          The final project is a chatbot where the customers can order their
          coffee.</p>
