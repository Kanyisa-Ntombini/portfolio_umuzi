        <h2>Hello there!</h2>
        <img src="./resources/images/professional-pic.jpg" alt="a black woman with short hair wearing a black shirt">
        <p>I am an aspiring self-taught Full Stack Web Developer. My interests are in Javascript and Python. For the past few months, I have been learning about Front End development using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am also interested in building chatbots and Machine Learning. As a result, I have been learning Python. You can find more information about me in my <a href="./resources/supporting_documents/Black & White Minimalistic Professional Resume.pdf">resume</a>.
          <br><br>
          I am partially sighted due to a condition called Keratoconus. This has led to me becoming a disability activist. I would like to build accessible websites so that all people are able to use them despite their physical or mental condition.
          <br><br>
          When I am not coding I like taking nature walks, looking for the cosiest coffee shops in town or spending time with my friends and family. I am also an avid knitter!</p>
